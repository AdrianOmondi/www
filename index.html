		<center><h3>
		<p>I enjoy creating seamless and impactful user and client experiences through research, design, and words. I currently live in Kenya, but I have had the privilege to work with different teams in Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, and South Africa. I have also worked in various sectors, notably-Health, entertainment, Agriculture, Transport, Fintech, and Finance.<br>
		Previously, I worked in banking as a teller and later on as a Priority and Business Clients service manager. During my time as a client-facing banker, I learned about the success any organization can reap by focusing on excellent client service and experience. Later on, when I joined the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology in 2018, I saw an opportunity to merge the client service experience gained from working at the bank with design, understanding the power of quantitative and qualitative research and human-computer interactions to become a UX/UI designer.<br>
		Understanding why people do what they do or act in a particular way is essential to creating impactful products. I love using my skill set to create experiences that make life easier.<b><br>UX/UI related courses<br></b> Simple ways tyo conduct a UX Audit<br>UX wrriting

        <h2>PARKIN APP</h2>
        <p>As the world slowly healed from the Covid-19 pandemic most companies explored ways of incorporating the
        hybrid form of work where some staff work from home and others from the office. This case study highlights my
        thought process about how i'd ensure that every staff who intends to work from the office,can book for parking
        and amend their requests

        <h2>VENDOOR</h2>
        <p >Just before Covid disrupted everything, we had this amzing idea of creating a 3D and VR powered event planning
        platform. This platform would help event owners and planners to visualise the event as they planned it. See why
        we stopped.
